My NIRS project for university
Recomended to run in python vitrualenv
There are packages that need to be downloaded, they are shown in "requirements.txt"
Enjoy yourself

HOW TO

There are 3 files
mod.py drawing.py testem.py

Run drawing.py, it would paint a heat map of all pilings with noise
if you run testem.py, it would apply em algorithm for data from mod.py and draw a map of it

Run em+hi+elbow.py to get results of work of all algorythms
